# Notes:

- AddBookButton`s conditional rendering is just for example of how I'd implement this technique using given principles.

# Launch project:

1. install dependencies: `yarn`. If you are using other IDE than vscode, you may need to specify it in postinstall script.

2. run tests: `yarn test`

3. start dev server: `yarn run dev`
